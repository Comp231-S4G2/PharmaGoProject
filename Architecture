We are following N-Layer Architecture, where each layer has its own responsibilities and communicates with each other to accomplish the task.
Based on our need and following Separation of concern and SOLID design principles, we are creating following layers:
1.	Business Object Layer(BOL)
It is mainly Collection of POCO(Plain Old CLR Object) classes used to establish mapping with table following EF principle.
2.	Data Access Layer(DAL)
               
                

3.	Business Logic Layer(BLL)

4.	MVC/UI Layer
